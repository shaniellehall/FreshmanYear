Q1: 	&¬;
	&∨;
	&∧;

Q2A: 	Indempotent
	a	a	|a
	0	0	|0
	0	1	|0
	1	0	|0
	1	1	|1

Q2B:	x'y + xy' + xy
	x'y + (xy' + xy) - y gets cancelled out
	x'y + x
	(x + x')(x + y) - (x + x') gets cancelled out
	x + y
	xy

	In the equation, both (x' & x) and (y & y') cancel each other out, so you are left with xy. 

Q3:	x	y	|x > y
	0	0	|0
	0	1	|0
	1	0	|1
	1	1	|0

	Boolean Expression : 	when x is 0 and y is 0, x > y = 0
				when x is 0 and y is 1, x > y = 0
				when x is 1 and y is 0, x > y = 1
				when x is 1 and y is 1, x > y = 0
	It cannot be simplified.

Q4:	N/A

Q5:	It took two gates to build.
	I think it would need 5 gates to compare 2 2-bit numbers. Since comparing 2 1-bit numbers took two gates, 2 times the amount would be 4 gates. Then there would be one AND gate at the end to join them together.

Q6:	It would need 16 rows, comparing both numbers by each other. For example:

	x	y
	00	00
	00	01
	00	10
	00	11
	
	This would have to be repeated for each instance of each number.

	To compare 2 3-bit numbers, you would need 64 rows.

	I think it would need 7 gates to compare 3-bit numbers. Since comparing 2 1-bit numbers took two gates, 3 times the amount would be 6 gates. Then there would be one AND gate at the end to join them together.

Comparing larger numbers would end up being too confusing for someone to follow along.

Q7:	Induction breaks down the comparison, making it easier follow along, and code.
Part A: false
Part B: To compare the two binary numbers, first you convert it to decimal. To convert from binary to decimal, you can do this calculation.

For the binary number 1100101101011001001 you would multiply each bit by 2 raised to the power of its position, starting from the right side. 

1100101101011001001

(1 x 2^0) (1 x 2^1) (1 x 2^2) ..... (1 x 2^16) (1 x 2^17) (1 x 2^18)

Once you do all that, you would add the sums to get your final answer.

Q8:	x	y	|x > y	x = y
	0	0	|0	1
	0	1	|0	0
	1	0	|1	0
	1	1	|0	1

Q9:	If x=y and x>y are both false, x would automatically be smaller than y.

Q10:  	g	e	Gr	|G
	0	0	0	|0
	0	0	1	|0
	0	1	0	|0
	0	1	1	|1
	1	0	0	|1
	1	0	1	|1
	1	1	0	|1
	1	1	1	|1

	G = g OR (e AND Gr)
