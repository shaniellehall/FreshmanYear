Q1: 	I did not run into any problems

Q2:	Pick variable names for all values, the sum, count and average of the values.
	Make a loop that will count the numbers, and add them until a negative number is read.
	Once you find the negative numbers, what do you do?
	What do you do at the end of the program.

Q3: 	Pick a set of numbers (5 numbers) and assign variable names to all of them.
	For each loop, check if the number is positive, and if it is, add 1 to the counter, add the number to sum sum, and move to the second number.

	If there is a negative number, stop the loop and calculate the avg.
	Print out the avg, sum, and count.

Q4:	Assign values to each variable name. Assign variable names for the counter,
	the sum, and the average. For each variable, first check if it is positive or
	negative. If it is negative, stop and print the sum, average and count. If the
	variable is positive, increment the counter by 1, and add the value of the
	variable to sum. Once all the values have been read, or there has been a 
	negative number, take the sum and divide it by the counter. Assign that value
	to the average. Print the sum, average and the count.

Q5:	The "fun" declaration declares the name, arguments(if any), and the function to be run.

Q6:	button and sread are the functions used to get user input. sread is more beneficial because it reads user input into a location.
	
Q7: 	tranqc 

Q8:	I ran into a few syntax errors. Most of them were formatting errors, like a missing "}". I would read the syntax error, and use "ctrl+/" to find the line number.


Q9:	My code produced the desired output.

Q10:	It worked, however I ran into a problem where the code would output the sum of all the positive numbers, instead of the ones before the negative numbers.
	I rearranged the code so that it would stop once a negative number is read.
